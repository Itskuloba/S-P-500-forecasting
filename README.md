# S-P-500-forecasting
S&P 500 Price Forecasting with Hybrid LSTM-Transformer Models
Project Overview
This project implements an LSTM-Transformer model to forecast daily S&P 500 index closing prices, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The model combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential dependencies and Transformer attention mechanisms for capturing long-term market trends. Additional features include anomaly detection for identifying high-risk market periods and interpretability via SHAP values to understand key drivers of predictions. The project is designed for providing insights for portfolio management, risk assessment, and investment strategies.
The primary data source is yfinance, fetching real-time S&P 500 data (^GSPC ticker) from Yahoo Finance, covering daily prices from 2010, to 2025. The project will include preprocessing, model training, evaluation and a Streamlit dashboard for interactive forecasting.
Objectives

Forecasting: Predict daily S&P 500 closing prices, incorporating features like returns, volatility, and lagged prices.
Risk Analysis: Detect anomalous price movements (e.g., market crashes) 
Interpretability: Analyze feature importance (e.g., impact of volatility) using SHAP values for transparent predictions.
Deployment: Deliver an interactive dashboard for visualizing forecasts and anomalies, suitable for financial analysts.

Dataset
Source

Provider: Yahoo Finance via yfinance Python library (pip install yfinance==0.2.44 for stability as of October 2025).
Ticker: ^GSPC (S&P 500 index).
Time Period: 2010 to 2025 .
Attributes: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, Volume.
Size: ~4,000 rows (daily data), 7 columns.
Access: Dynamically fetched using:import yfinance as yf


LSTM-Transformer Model:
LSTM: Captures short-term sequential dependencies in price movements (e.g., daily momentum).
Transformer: Using multi-head self-attention to model long-term trends (e.g., yearly cycles or market regimes).
Architecture: LSTM layers feed into Transformer encoder; final dense layer outputs price predictions.


Ensemble Stacking: Combines LSTM-Transformer with XGBoost to improve robustness; meta-learner weights predictions.
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) identify outliers in price/return series (e.g., 2020 crash).
Probabilistic Modeling: Bayesian Neural Networks estimate uncertainty in forecasts (95% confidence intervals).
Interpretability: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for feature importance (e.g., volatility vs. lagged price).
Optimization: Adam optimizer; Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.

Deployment:
Build Streamlit dashboard for interactive forecasts and anomaly visualizations.


Evaluation Metrics

Forecasting:
RMSE/MAE: Target RMSE < 50 points on normalized prices.
Directional Accuracy: >60% correct up/down predictions.


Anomaly Detection:
Precision-Recall AUC: Target >0.85 for rare events (e.g., crashes).


Uncertainty:
Coverage Probability: 95% confidence intervals should contain true prices >90% of the time.


Business Insight:
SHAP-based feature ranking (e.g., volatility > lagged price).
Dashboard usability: Tested with sample financial analyst feedback.



Expected Results

Forecasts: Accurate 30-day price predictions with confidence intervals (e.g., ±2% error on average).
Anomalies: Detection of major market events (e.g., March 2020 crash, 2022 bear market).
Insights: Clear identification of volatility as a key driver, informing risk-averse investment strategies.
Dashboard: Interactive tool showing predicted prices, anomaly flags, and SHAP explanations.

Challenges and Solutions

Non-Stationarity: Addressed via differencing and ADF tests (statsmodels.tsa.stattools.adfuller).
Overfitting: Mitigated with dropout (0.2) in LSTM/Transformer and L2 regularization in XGBoost.
yfinance Rate Limits: Cache data locally to avoid API throttling.
Long Training Times: Use Google Colab with GPU for faster training (TensorFlow/PyTorch compatible).

Future Extensions

Multimodal Inputs: Add news sentiment via NewsAPI (free tier) for sentiment-driven forecasting.
Real-Time Updates: Schedule yfinance pulls daily via cron jobs for live predictions.
